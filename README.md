# Distance-Sensor
For this project, a HC-SR04 sensor is used to measure the distance from an object and alert the user through an LED illumination 
and message on the OLED screen when the object is within a certain distance from the Arduino. In addition, by using a potentiometer
the user is able to set at what distance the Arduino will alert them and is able to see the distance recorded on an OLED display.
The user also has the ability to start and stop the measuring of the distance on the Arduino through two buttons which indicates
with the illumination of an LED.
